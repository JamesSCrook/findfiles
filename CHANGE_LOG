v0.0.1	- Initial FOSS version




v0.0.2 Changes that are _NOT_ backward compatibile:

1.  The meaning of "-" (minus sign vs plus sign or equivalently, no minus sign) is reversed
    when specifying an age value with the "-A" and "-M" options. (So now "-" means the same
    as it does for "-a" and "-m".)

2. "Y" Year(s) and "M" Month(s) are calculated correctly (not 365D and 30D, as they were before)

3. Daylight Savings time is handled correctly (if one can say such a thing for discontinuous time!).


v0.0.2 Changes that are backward compatibile:

1.  --long_options now require only the minumum number of characters to be unique (like getopt_long).

2.  process_object now uses timestamp (Epoch) times, not ages.

3.  Cosmetic changes such as better indenting and renaming varibles and functions.
