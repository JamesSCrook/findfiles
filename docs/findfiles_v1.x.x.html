<h2>findfiles Version 1.x.x (deprecated)</h2>

<b><font color="red">
findfiles version 1.x.x is has 1 second time resolution. As such, it is deprecated and no longer supported.
Please use findfiles version 2+ (with 'nanosecond' time resolution).
</font></b> 
<p>
But, this is what version 1.x.x does...
<p>

findfiles finds file system objects in a UNIX-like environment and lists them in time (of last modification
and/or access) order. It's been tested on on Linux, AIX and Cygwin.
Download <a href="https://github.com/JamesSCrook/findfiles.git"><b>findfiles</b></a> from github.
<p>
But we already have find for that, right? Correct, but findfiles has more of a <u>time focus</u> and adheres
more closely to the traditional UNIX philosophy of "do one thing and do it well".

<h3>Simple findfiles Examples</h3>

These are common uses cases. findfiles always lists the objects in time sorted order.
<ol class="padbottom">
    <li>List all the files in the /app directory tree that were modified less than 30 seconds ago:
	<br>
	<b>findfiles -fr -m -30s /app</b>
    </li>
    <li>List all the files in the Videos directory tree for files named '*.mpg' or "*.mp4' modified
	less than 2 weeks ago and also the files in the Photos directory tree named '*.jpg' or "*.jpeg'
	modified more than 1 month ago (all case insensitive) in verbose mode, reverse sort:
	<br>
	<b>findfiles -vfr -iRm -2W -p '\.mp[g4]$' Videos -m +1M -p '\.jpg$|\.jpeg$' Photos</b>
    </li>
    <li>List all the files in the /dblogs and /var/log directories modified later than lastlogfile was:
	<br>
	<b>findfiles -f -M -lastlogfile /dblogs /var/log</b>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
findfiles classifies file system objects as one of these three types: (regular) <u>files</u>,
<u>directories</u>, and "<u>other</u>" (e.g., pipes, block specials, symbolic links, etc.)

<h3>The findfiles Usage Message</h3>

See toward the bottom of the findfiles usage message for more examples of how to use it:
<div style="overflow:auto; background:#CCFFCC; height:400px">
<pre>
usage (version 1.0.2):
findfiles [OPTION]... [target|-t target]... [OPTION]... [target|-t target]...
 Some OPTIONs require arguments. These are:
  age    : a +/- relative age value followed by a time unit
  ERE    : a POSIX-style Extended Regular Expression (pattern)
  path   : the pathname of a reference object (file, directory, etc.)
  target : the pathname of an object (file, directory, etc.) to search
 OPTIONs - can be toggled on/off (parsed left to right):
  -d|--directories : directories   (default off)
  -f|--files       : regular files (default off)
  -o|--others      : other files   (default off)
  -r|--recursive   : recursive - traverse file trees (default off)
  -i|--ignore-case : case insensitive pattern match - invoke before -p option (default off)

 Time units:
  Y: Years    M: Months     W: Weeks      D: Days
  h: hours    m: minutes    s: seconds
  Note: Specify Y, M & s with integer values. W, D, h & m can also take floating point values.

  -dRp pat junk                # directories named junk/*pat* - reverse sort
  -rfM -/etc/hosts /lib        # files in the /lib tree modified after /etc/hosts was
  -fvm -3h / /tmp -fda 1h /var # files in / or /tmp modified &lt= 3 hours, and dirs (but
                               # NOT files) in /var accessed &gt= 1h, verbose output

<h3>Both findfiles <u>and</u> find?</h3>

<ul class="padbottom">
    <li>Yes! Because they do different things and <b><u>both</u> are incredibly useful</b>!
    </li>
    <li>GNU find is a fantastic utility! It does an amazing number of things. When it comes to finding,
	it does nearly everything - it's like 128 Swiss Army knives all bolted together.
	But for things that findfiles does, find's command line syntax is rather complex
	and unwieldy. That's when findfiles is useful.
    </li>
    <li>findfiles' output is always sorted by time in some way.

<h3>More Complicated findfiles Examples</h3>

<ol class="padbottom">
    <li>View the all the files in the /tmp tree modified in the last 10 seconds and in the /var/tmp tree
	accessed in the last 2 minutes - least recent files first:
	<br>
	<b>view $(findfiles -Rfr -m -10s /tmp -a -2m /var/tmp)</b>
    </li>
    <li>Remove all files in the /tmp and /var/tmp trees that were last modified 1 year ago or more.
	(Obviously you shouldn't do this if you have files that might still be required after a year!)
	<br>
	<b>rm $(findfiles -fr -m +1Y /tmp /var/tmp)</b>
    </li>
    <li>No access or modification times have been specified, so the default value ('-m 0s') means all
	possible modification times (including future times) and the default patter ('-p ".*"') meaning all
	patterns.
	<br>
	<b>findfiles -vf .</b>
	<pre>
20160510_101641      0D_00:15:11              30   ./barfoo
20160510_101638      0D_00:15:14              30   ./foobar
20160510_101633      0D_00:15:19              30   ./bar
20160510_101630      0D_00:15:22              30   ./foo
	</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Same as the above example, but with reverse sort, times displayed in seconds ('-s'), and units (both
	's' and 'B') displayed with the units option ('-u'):
	<br>
	<b>findfiles -vfRsu .</b>
	<pre>
20160510_101630             922s              30B  ./foo
20160510_101633             919s              30B  ./bar
20160510_101638             914s              30B  ./foobar
20160510_101641             911s              30B  ./barfoo
	</pre>
    </li>
    <li>A verbosity of >1 when using time of last modification and/or access shows additional time information:
	<br>
	<b>findfiles -vvf -m -2M . -a 3m /tmp</b>
	<pre>
i: start time:      1462792747s = Mon 09 May 2016 <b><font color="red">21</font></b>:19:07 <b><font color="blue">AEST</font></b>

i:      61.00000D =    5270400s last modified after (newer than) target time
i: start time:      1462792747s = Mon 09 May 2016 21:19:07 AEST
i: target time:     1462792567s = Mon 09 May 2016 21:16:07 AEST
i:       0.00208D =        180s last accessed before (older than) target time
...

20160505_170053      4D_04:18:14            2258   ./bar
...
	</pre>
	Note <b><font color="red">the hour difference (21 vs 22 hours)</font></b> and
	<b><font color="blue">the time zone change (AEST vs AEDT)</font></b> when looking
	back 2 months. DST was in effect then (Mar) and "now" (May) is standard time (southern hemisphere!).
    </li>
    <li>The same as the example above, but this time a timezone with no DST (UTC) has been specified.
	Note that the hour and timezone values are unchanged:
	<p>
	<b>export TZ=UTC; findfiles -vvf -m -2M .</b>
	<pre>
i: start time:      1462793131s = Mon 09 May 2016 11:25:31 UTC
i: target time:     1457522731s = Wed 09 Mar 2016 11:25:31 UTC

    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol class="padbottom">
    <li>The output of findfiles is time focused - time of last access and/or last modification.
	Even if there is no time specified on the command line, the output is sorted by time.</li>
    <li>The default sort order is newest first (decreasing).</li>
    <li>findfiles parses (and processes) command line arguments (targets and options) in left to
	right (L-R) order.</li>
    <li>Some command line options are flags that can be toggled on/off (parsed L-R).</li>
    <li>Some command line options require parameters that can be set and reset (parsed L-R).</li>
    <li>Some command line options are global - they cannot be toggled on/off.</li>
    <li>--long-options are supported, but getopt_long was not used because of the L-R requirement.
	As a result, "--" does not work (i.e., not the way getopt_long handles it).</li>
    <li>If findfiles is instructed to find some objects based on last modification time and
	others based on last access time, the output will be sorted based whichever time (last
	access or last modification) was requested for each object.</li>
    <li>Integer or floating point number(s) of weeks, days, hours or minutes may be specified.</li>
    <li>Only integer numbers of years, months and seconds may be specified because years and
	months are variable in length, and 1 second is the minimum resolution.</li>
    <li>As with any command (even find), be extremely careful when calling rm or mv, e.g.:
	<b>rm $(findfiles -fr -m 1Y /tmp /var/tmp)</b> !
        findfiles might not return any files, so rm would have no argument!</li>
    <li>findfiles has been observed to report negative times. This has been observed mainly
	when searching the entire file system (/). It is not known how this is possible, but
	don't be alarmed if you observe it.</li>
